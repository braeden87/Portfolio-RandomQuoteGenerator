## Project Description
This project displays a quote at the center of the page along with a few buttons that do the following:
- New Quote: Generates a new Quote
- Twitter: Posts the Quote to twitter
- Log In: Opens a form that allows the user to log in (so that they can then save the quotes)
  - Save Quote: Once logged in this button will appear and will allow the User to Save the Quote
  - Saved Quote List: Opens to a new page that displays a list of saved quotes
  - Log Out: Would log the user out

This project utilizes both the twitter API and the Forismatic API. The forismatic API is used to generate the quotes and the twitter API is used to post them to twitter. 

## Inspiration For Project Creation
While learning javascript I was taking an online course that reuired me to create a random quote project that would pull quotes from an API and then post them to the screen. I did this and then added a lot of functionality to it.
